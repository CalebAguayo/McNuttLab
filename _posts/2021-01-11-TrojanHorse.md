Two research groups have designed chimeric fusion proteins that constitute a new “trojan horse” approach to neutralize lethal botulinum toxins.

Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs)—a family of bacterial toxins with seven major serotypes (BoNT/A to BoNT/G)—are classified by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as one of the most dangerous bioterrorism agents. BoNTs infiltrate into motor neurons, block neurotransmitter release, and stop essential functions such as breathing.
