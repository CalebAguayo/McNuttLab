I'm an Army veteran with Bachelor of science. I currently work full-time in research lab technician at Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine and part-time as a CNA/tech at Forsyth Medical Center. Long term I want to work in a job where I can utilize my interest in biology and team building to help translating scientific knowledge into improving patients lives.
