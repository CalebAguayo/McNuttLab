I hold a PhD in biochemistry from the Indian Institute of Toxicology Research, Lucknow, and completed my post-doctoral training at the US Environmental Protection Agency and Atrium Health - Wake Forest University School of Medicine. I have extensive research experience in both experimental animal models and human subjects, with a strong foundation in toxicology, biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, physiology, and pharmacology. My expertise spans a broad range of laboratory techniques, including cellular and molecular biology, biochemical analysis, and analytical biochemistry such as HPLC, LC-MS, affinity column chromatography, PCR, multi-well plate-based immunoassays, ELISA, radioimmunoassay (RIA), cell/tissue culture, as well as immunological and histopathological techniques. Additionally, my leadership and management skills have been crucial in successfully managing NIH and foundation-funded research projects, mentoring junior researchers, and developing compelling grant applications. I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to the various research projects currently underway in Dr. McNuttâ€™s laboratories at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. Outside of work, my hobbies include cooking, watching comedy movies, and playing badminton, ping-pong and cricket with family and friends.
