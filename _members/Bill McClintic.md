Bill McClintic holds a postdoctoral fellow position at Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine. His current research focus is on developing therapeutics to address molecular pathologies of the neuromuscular junction. Strategies include applying in vivo, ex vivo, and in vitro platforms to evaluate individual small molecules based on structure function principles, adjunctive small molecule therapies using a systems biology approach, and development of lipid nanoparticle drug delivery vehicles with neurotropism. Bill was a postdoctoral research associate at the University of Tennessee investigating the effect of cell membrane leaflet asymmetry using synthetic lipid membranes. His PhD research was on developing synthetic platforms of heterosynaptic plasticity that emulate the structure and function of the neurological synapse for applications in next generation computing hardware. Bill enjoys spending time with his family, beer mixology, and exercising.
